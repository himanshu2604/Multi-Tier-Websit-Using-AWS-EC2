## Architecture Summary

The ABC Company Multi-Tier Website is built using a **3-tier architecture** pattern on AWS, providing separation of concerns, high availability, and scalability. This architecture follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles for reliability, security, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and operational excellence.

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between presentation, application, and data layers
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with redundancy at each tier
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Security by Design**: Layered security with principle of least privilege
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use model with automated resource management

## System Components

### AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose | Configuration | Cost Tier |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Amazon EC2** | Web application hosting | t2.micro instances | Free Tier |
| **Amazon RDS** | Managed MySQL database | db.t3.micro Multi-AZ | Free Tier |
| **Application Load Balancer** | Traffic distribution | Internet-facing ALB | Standard |
| **Auto Scaling Group** | Instance management | 2-6 instances, CPU-based | Free |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitoring & alarms | Metrics and scaling triggers | Free Tier |
| **VPC** | Network isolation | Custom VPC with subnets | Free |
| **Security Groups** | Network security | Stateful firewall rules | Free |

    D --> E[EC2 Instance 1]

    E --> G[RDS MySQL]

    end

        E
        F
    end
    
    subgraph "Private Subnet - DB Tier"
        G
    end
```

### Detailed Request Processing
1. **User Request**: Browser sends HTTP request to ALB DNS name
2. **Load Balancer**: ALB receives request and performs health checks
3. **Target Selection**: ALB selects healthy EC2 instance using round-robin
4. **Web Server**: Apache processes PHP code on selected instance
5. **Database Query**: PHP application connects to RDS MySQL
6. **Data Retrieval**: Database returns query results
7. **Response Generation**: PHP generates HTML response
8. **Response Delivery**: Response sent back through ALB to user

### Auto Scaling Trigger Flow
```
High CPU Load → CloudWatch Alarm → Auto Scaling Policy → Launch New Instance → Register with Target Group → Health Check → Receive Traffic
```

## High Availability Design

### Multi-Tier Redundancy

**Presentation Tier HA:**
- Multiple EC2 instances across different AZs
- Application Load Balancer with health checks
- Auto Scaling Group ensures minimum capacity
- Rolling updates with zero downtime

**Application Tier HA:**
- Stateless application design
- Multiple instances for redundancy
- Session persistence through load balancer
- Automatic instance replacement on failure

**Data Tier HA:**
- RDS Multi-AZ deployment
- Automated failover in case of primary failure
- Continuous data replication to standby
- Point-in-time recovery capability

### Failure Scenarios & Recovery

| Failure Type | Detection Method | Recovery Action | Recovery Time |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Single EC2 Instance** | ELB Health Check | ASG launches replacement | 2-5 minutes |
| **Availability Zone** | Multi-AZ deployment | Traffic routes to other AZ | 30-60 seconds |
| **Database Primary** | RDS monitoring | Automatic failover to standby | 60-120 seconds |
| **Load Balancer** | AWS managed service | AWS handles replacement | Minimal impact |

## Security Architecture

### Network Security Layers

**Internet Gateway Security:**
- Only ALB accessible from internet
- All other resources in private subnets
- NACLs for additional network-level security

**Application Load Balancer Security:**
- Security group allows HTTP/HTTPS from internet
- SSL/TLS termination (when configured)
- WAF integration capability

**Web Tier Security:**
- Security group allows traffic only from ALB
- SSH access restricted to specific IP ranges
- No direct internet access from instances

**Database Tier Security:**
- Security group allows traffic only from web tier
- No internet access
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network isolation in private subnets
